# Why go ARM?


# Notes
- The source code for my [Golang rasterization program can be found here](https://github.com/JohnTGZ/Rasterization-GO)
- Diagrams were made with [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)
- I tried to follow [4] for the pseudo code syntax.
- I have been trying to learn markdown formatting properly and [this guide helped me tremendously](https://gist.github.com/apaskulin/1ad686e42c7165cb9c22f9fe1e389558).
- Please let me know if there are any inconsistencies or misstated facts at john_tanguanzhong@hotmail.com
