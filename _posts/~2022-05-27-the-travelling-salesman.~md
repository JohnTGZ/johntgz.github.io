title: "The Travelling Salesman - Dynamic Programming and Branch-and-bound method"
---

When it comes to TSP, I see rather unsatisfactory explainations out there, or rather, no easy ones for the lazy mind. Today I shall attempt to illumination this classic problem with visual representations and diagrams. There are [multiple approaches to TSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem), with the most commonly discussed being [Dynamic Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPQY__2H3tE&ab_channel=Reducible) and [Branch and Bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_bound), which will be the focus today.
