Don't you think its fascinating how lines and circles are rendered on pixels?
I've been wanting to do this for a while now, to code from scratch Brehensam and Wu's line algorithm in Golang.

## Introduction


## Good ol' Brehensam
There are plenty of articles out there explaining the Brehensam Line Algorithm and there is a [particular one I like](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/group/goa/mallinnus/lines/bresenh.html). I think he/she did a hella good job and I would like to provide the following pseudocode for the 8 octants as a supplement.

### The 8 Octants
Show diagram for 8 octants
Give pseudocode for each

### Challenges for drawing images



## Anti-aliasing you say?

Talk about Wu's algorithm


## The only house I can afford


## Comparism between Wu and Brehensam
