# My Experiences

## Career

### Globotix
Robotics Software Engineer (2021 - Present)

### Movel AI
Robotics Software Engineer (2020 - 2021)
- I worked on improving the perception and navigation stack of Movel’s AGV system. For perception, I have worked on a pipeline to utilise lidar point clouds for use in SLAM, developed autonomous docking systems based on fiducials and deep learning for human planners and developed several state of the art motion planning algorithms from research papers (both anytime and replanning variants) including Anytime Dynamic A*, Hybrid A* and State Lattice Planner. I have also written motor and sensor drivers and have hands-on experience in integrating ROS-based systems on AGVs from the ground up. 

## Internships

### 南京旭拟仿真技术有限公司 - Shanghai City, China
Mechanical Engineering Intern (2019)
- I worked on the analysis and development of a 6 Degree of Freedom Flight Simulator (Stewart Platform). Some of the skills I used were Solidworks, Matlab and Simulink. I did Technical drafting, CAD and kinematics simulation on solidworks, and wrote algorithms in MATLAB regarding the inverse kinematics of the Stewart platform to analyse it’s reachable workspace. In Simulink, I built a virtual model for the hardware engineers to test and visualise their algorithms.

### Iron Drone - Tel Aviv, Israel
Mechanical Engineering Intern (2018)
- Iron Drone is an anti-drone company, based in Tel Aviv, developing autonomous solutions for aerial threats in sensitive airspaces such as airports, military installations etc. During my internship, I worked together with the team on numerous technical projects. I worked on various anti-drone mechanisms that can be mounted as a payload onto drones. I also worked on debugging autonomous navigation algorithms and testing them in a simulation. Another project I worked on was the design of a lightweight and structurally rigid gimbal that can be customized (through parametric design) and replicated (through 3D Printing) to fit different fpv cameras and drones. Throughout my stint, SOLIDWORKS, additive manufacturing and OpenCV (Python) was used extensively.

### Aural-Aid
Product Development Intern (2018)
- My main task was to develop an IOT based variable Helmholtz resonator . In this project, I designed the iris mechanism that allowed the control of a variable aperture and utilised Fast Fourier Transformation for signal processing on a Teensy 3.2 development board. In addition, I utilised a laser cutter and 3D printer for my prototyping. Through the process, Solidworks, C++ and AUTOCAD were used extensively. 

## Education

### National University of Singapore
Bachelor of Engineering - BE, Mechanical Engineering (2016 - 2020)
